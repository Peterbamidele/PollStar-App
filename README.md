# Pollstar-App
Django is a python-based web framework that follows the model-template-view architechtual pattern. Django is fast, secure, and scalable! This is my first Django project, a simple poll app built with help from this tutorial. It consists of a public site that lets people view polls and vote in them, as well as an admin site to add, change, and delete polls.
